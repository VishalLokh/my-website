        <p>Hello! I'm Vishal Lokhande, a Network Engineer with expertise in designing, deploying, and maintaining network infrastructures. I hold a Master's degree in Network Engineering from Southern Methodist University, where I gained hands-on experience with a wide range of networking technologies, including switching, routing, network automation, and cloud networking.</p>
        <p>Throughout my career, I have worked with organizations to implement robust network solutions, troubleshoot complex network issues, and optimize network performance. I'm passionate about automating network configurations using tools like Python and Ansible, and I'm always eager to explore new technologies in the fields of networking and cloud infrastructure.</p>
        <p>Currently, I'm based in Dallas, TX, and I'm actively looking for opportunities further to grow my skills in network engineering and automation.</p>

        <h2>AWS Automation Project</h2>
        <p>This portfolio website is part of an AWS automation project where I leveraged various AWS services to streamline the deployment and management process.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>AWS S3:</strong> The website is hosted on Amazon S3, ensuring high availability and performance.</li>
            <li><strong>AWS CodePipeline:</strong> The deployment of the website is automated using AWS CodePipeline, allowing continuous integration and delivery. Any updates committed to the GitHub repository are automatically deployed to the S3 bucket.</li>
            <li><strong>AWS Lambda:</strong> A Lambda function is used to set the correct metadata automatically (`Content-Type: text/html`) for the files uploaded to the S3 bucket, ensuring proper display of the website content.</li>
            <li><strong>Automation Scripts:</strong> I created automation scripts using Python and Bash for managing updates and deployments, reducing manual intervention.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Overall, this project demonstrates my ability to integrate cloud services and automate deployment pipelines for real-world web applications.</p>
