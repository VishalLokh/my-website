        <p>Hello! I'm Vishal Lokhande, a Network Engineer with expertise in designing, deploying, and maintaining network infrastructures. I hold a Master's degree in Network Engineering from Southern Methodist University, where I gained hands-on experience with a wide range of networking technologies, including switching, routing, network automation, and cloud networking.</p>
        <p>Throughout my career, I have worked with various organizations to implement robust network solutions, troubleshoot complex network issues, and optimize network performance. I'm passionate about automating network configurations using tools like Python and Ansible, and I'm always eager to explore new technologies in the fields of networking and cloud infrastructure.</p>
        <p>Currently, I'm based in Dallas, TX, and I'm actively looking for opportunities to further grow my skills in network engineering and automation.</p>

        <h2>Automating Website Deployment with AWS CLI and GitHub</h2>
        <p>In this project, I created a fully automated process for deploying and updating my personal website on AWS. Rather than using a CDN, I utilized AWS CLI and a custom Bash script to streamline the entire deployment process from my local machine to the AWS cloud. The key steps involved are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Website Development:</strong> I first developed the website locally using HTML, CSS, and other static files. This included creating an <code>index.html</code> page, along with associated stylesheets and images.</li>
            <li><strong>AWS S3 Bucket Setup:</strong> I hosted the website using an AWS S3 bucket configured for static website hosting. The S3 bucket was set up to store the website files and make them accessible to users.</li>
            <li><strong>Automation with AWS CLI:</strong> To ensure a smooth and continuous deployment process, I created a Bash script using AWS CLI commands. This script automates the upload of updated files from my local device directly to the S3 bucket, eliminating the need for manual updates.</li>
            <li><strong>Version Control with GitHub:</strong> I used GitHub for version control, allowing me to track changes to the website’s codebase. Any updates made to the local code are committed to a GitHub repository, ensuring version history and collaboration support.</li>
            <li><strong>Continuous Deployment:</strong> Whenever I make changes to the website locally, I run the Bash script to automatically push updates to the AWS S3 bucket, ensuring the website is always up-to-date without manual intervention.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This project showcases my ability to use cloud-based tools like AWS, along with Bash scripting and GitHub for automation, to create an efficient and scalable workflow for website deployment.</p>
